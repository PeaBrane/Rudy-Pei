In classical economics, a potential offender is treated as a [rational agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory) that seeks to maximize the expected utility when deciding whether to commit a crime. Therefore, if the perceived threat of legal punishment outweights the gains from the crime action, then the offender is [deterred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_(penology)). However, in reality, there are complex [behavioral traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory) governing the risk perception of each individual that deviate from rationality. These effects need to be captured in order to construct a [general model of deterrence](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3457220).
