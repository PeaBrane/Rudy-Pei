Unlike ferromagnetic spin models, a [spin glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_glass) has a highly non-trivial phase transition profile. For mean field models (the SK spin glass), the glass experiences a [replica-symmetry breaking phenomenon](http://www.lptms.u-psud.fr/membres/mezard/Pdf/84_MPSTV_JDP.pdf) that is only fully understood [recently](https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1003). However, for [short-range models](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9906076), essentially nothing is known [rigorously](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783764357771), including basic questions such as the existence of a finite-temperature phase transition. A potential route towards settling such problems may rely on a suitable generalization of the [random cluster model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_cluster_model) as a [universal](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02338) statistical tool.
