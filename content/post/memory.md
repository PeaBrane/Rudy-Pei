The [universality classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universality_class) of equilibrium phase transitions of many statistical models are well known. On the other hand, very little is understood about the phenomenon of [non-equilibrium criticality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_phenomena#Critical_dynamics), including its existence. Nonetheless, from [numerical simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04557), it appears that memory effects are fundamental driving forces behind dynamic criticality. They are capable of establishing long-range order irrespective of the structure of the equilibrium model. A theoretical understanding of the role of memory in complex systems is important to understanding critical phenomenon as a whole.

When we endow memory to a spin glass, the dynamics will act to steadily decrease the effective temperature of the glass (left figure), in a regime that is continuously near dynamic criticality (the polynomial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_critical_exponents" target="_blank">cluster size distribution</a> in the right figure).
